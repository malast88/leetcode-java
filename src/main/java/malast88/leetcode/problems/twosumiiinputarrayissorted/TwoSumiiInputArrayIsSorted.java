     * Solution for https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/
     * Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
     * The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
     * Note:
     * Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
     * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
     * @param numbers
     * @param target
     * @return
